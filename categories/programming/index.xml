      <title>TikZ coordinate graph from scratch. The simple, but effective way.</title>

      <description>Lately I had to create a graph to exemplify something in a document. I was somehow familiar with TikZ but given the immense amount of templates online it was quite difficult to stick to one, because most of them had so many unnesesary features for my purpose. Therefore, using the two references listed at the bottom I came up with something quite useful and intuitive to use a template to solve my problem.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of your own Stata command with Mata-generated data.</title>

      <description>This the final step of a series of earlier post where I dealed with the combination of a Mata evaluators within ado files that uses ml to fit Maximum Likelihood Estimations. Here a single dofile is used but it relies in what we have done in my previous post when we built up MyClogit command.
The only file needed is the following, and it can be downloaded by clicking on it.</description>

      <description>If you are reading this you should be quite desperate to get an answer about how to deal with the impossible [holy] trinity of put together a (1) d-family Mata evaluator, within an (2) ado file (a.k.a your own new command) that performs a maximum likelihood estimation using (3) -ml- invoking your Mata evaluator. Let me say that you are probably (?) in the write place.
Indeed, this post is an improved version of a later post where I fitted a conditional logit using -ml- with Mata-based likelihood function.</description>

      <description>This post is higly based on the excellent book Maximum likelihood estimation with Stata. Stata press Gould, W., Pitblado, J., &amp;amp; Sribney, W. (2006) and by any means tries to be a replacement for such an amazing reference. However, within the chapter 6 devoted to d-family -ml- evaluators, somehow something, in my humble opinion, very important was missing. The missing part was the discussion of Discrete Choice Models as a particular family of models specially suitable for such family of evaluators where ikelihood function does not meet the linearform restrictions.</description>

      <title>Are my labels there? Searching among label variables values on Stata</title>

      <description>The problem This brief post answer the question my orignal google search How to check if a value is contained into a label variable on stata?
Imagine we have a problem where we need to check if a string is contained into the labels of another variable. Let’s start with a minimal example using sysuse auto and the variable foreing which is the only one with labels already in place.</description>
