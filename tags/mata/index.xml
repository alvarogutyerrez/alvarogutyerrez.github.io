      <description>This post is higly based on the excellent book Maximum likelihood estimation with Stata. Stata press Gould, W., Pitblado, J., &amp;amp; Sribney, W. (2006) and by any means tries to be a replacement for such an amazing reference. However, within the chapter 6 devoted to d-family -ml- evaluators, somehow something, in my humble opinion, very important was missing. The missing part was the discussion of Discrete Choice Models as a particular family of models specially suitable for such family of evaluators where ikelihood function does not meet the linearform restrictions.</description>
